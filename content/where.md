I host this site on GitHub Pages, since hosting it on my local internet connection is a pain.

If you're asking where I live, you can find me at the Wintervale Manor. If you're asking for physical location, go away. I don't take kindly to creeps. Unless you show up with alcohol, in which case, do email me. (Don't.)

For my socials, please check the [socials page](https://0ccu.lt/socials/) in the 0ccult directory.
