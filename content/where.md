I host this site on GitHub Pages, since getting consistent routing to and from the Starry Point Lighthouse is a pain. I could do it from the Tunnelvision Arcade, but I already have enough power hungry cabinets in there as it is.

If you're asking where I live, you can find me at the Starry Point Lighthouse on the Innernet. If you're asking for physical location, go away. I don't take kindly to creeps. Unless you show up with alcohol, in which case, email me. (Don't.)

For my socials, please check the [socials page](https://0ccu.lt/socials/) in the 0ccult directory.
