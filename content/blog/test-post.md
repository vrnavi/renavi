{McDonalds and You}

<!--more-->

McDonalds and you, McDonalds and you
Fresh scrambled eggs, sausage, hotcakes, juice and coffee too
Just like sunshine every morning, McDonalds and you!

{The audience cheers as the band changes songs}

"I tell you what, we got you wherever you go on the radio
"Whether you're in your car or your house
"Whether you're in your office building or whether your in your home
"I'll tell you what, the television's the only thing that gets your attention besides the radio, besides the wife (huh)
"And I'll tell you what we even gotcha on the television, remember this one?:"

{Coors to You}

Coors to you, Coors to you
Rocky mountain gold, you got it, the best of the Rockies is yours!
Coors to you, all night cool
Rocky mountain gold, you got it, the best of the Rockies is yours!
