This was going to be a placeholder with nothing but a Serial Experiments Lain reference, but that'd be ridiculous.

I wonder how many blogs have those. Just random unused corners of the internet with nothing but a single reference to a cult classic show.

I don't get it. It's like they're locked in a limbo of being super basic compared to the others and eccentric considering not many people run their own blogs anymore.

A lost art, I guess.

Maybe I should add a comments section, too.
