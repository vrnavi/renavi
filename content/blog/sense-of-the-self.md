Oh great, it's time for Ren's yearly blog post to annoy the hell out of everyone, eh?

<!--more-->

Hello, again. Don't know if I was missed, or if people even read this, but that's okay. I'm getting more at peace with things, and my own self. It really is a process, one that isn't easy, but one that gets easier by the day.

First off, I took down my Folding@Home rant. Foolish person writes a foolish diatribe, who would have known? Besides, it isn't exactly that easy to set it up, looking at it now, and in hindsight. My GPUs won't work for it unless I'm on Windows, so as much as I wish for my dream of my 2010 Mac Pro to continue its life as a space heater crunching numbers for good, maybe some things are best left to purpose built systems... but I digress. And I apologize to anyone I made feel inferior with that rant, given not everyone has hardware lying around... keep yourselves warm this winter, yes?

Now, if I could reintroduce myself, since I've been doing housekeeping on who I am and how I show. Hello. I am Ren, or Ren Avi, or renavi. A kitsune witch, of sorts, one simply trying to enjoy peace and quiet without drama nor stress. Lapis is now separate, a product of my writing. She is fictional, in a sense. Her home will still be over [there](https://starrypoint.me), so that can continue when the time comes.

Going a bit more in detail, I am plural, myself. "Ren" is the name for all of us, or the vessel. Within, there are four, maybe more. The only two you need be concerned with is I, "Dareka", and the other, "Kagami". We share the same space. Though I am perfectly fine with people knowing about my plurality, I do not wish to be annoying with it, so it is unlikely I will divulge this information anywhere other than here. Well, that, and I've already [had that rant before](https://ren.0ccu.lt/blog/give-it-time/).

Looking back on it, a lot of my writing was filled with vitriol. Angst at the world, for one reason or another, when I have told myself countless times that I must simply accept what is to live properly. Asking too many questions will drive one insane, but asking too few will leave one ignorant. A balance, of sorts.

I only wish for peace and quiet. Peas in quite, no? So I will continue writing for myself, with the Whistler SAI and Lapis and all of that fun stuff. Maybe you'll see us around, in those stories. *Does it count as a self-insert if I am self-inserting my own "sona" into my own stories? Possibly.*

Though I do wish to write predominantly safe for work content, I am a fox. I have those urges as well. So I do write some NSFW content, from time to time. I won't be posting them anywhere accessible from here, but if you truly want to find it, I won't stop you. Some [certain octopus](https://sanitized.ink) keeps running off with those.

But enough of that, that site doesn't even exist yet. It's all just for the show, is it not? Love of the displays, and for the spectacle.

Ciao, lot. We'll talk again, soon.
