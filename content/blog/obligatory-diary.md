I haven't posted anything in a while.

Life really does tend to happen. You take days making a building, only to never move in.

I want to move in now. I've spent so long adjusting things for the [OneShot Discord](https://discord.gg/oneshot) that I completely forgot about this place.

I have a stronger desire to get back to existing here now, though. Maybe I'll start by writing more of my thoughts down here.

I like this place. It's like a large, empty room, with plenty of space for my thoughts. It's really unlike Twitter, though a bit less interactive than something like Mastodon or Akkoma...

Still, a permanent record for my thoughts is nice. You don't get that elsewhere. I've been using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for a sort-of daily journal, but that'll never get posted anywhere for obvious reasons.

I'll put things I want to make clear here, too.

For now though, I should probably get back to writing. Whistler can't fill that log alone.
