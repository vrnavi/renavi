I haven't posted anything in a while. Again.

<!--more-->

I keep realizing that I'll write something for a post somewhere in my own digital town (so to speak), and move on before coming back to it a month later.

Maybe I'll try and use that more to my advantage. There's nothing wrong with being patient with oneself, and taking one's time before releasing something into the void.

I wonder who watches me, if anyone. If these words *are* being read, then, hello! I don't get many visitors.

Also guess I might actually be somewhat decent with Python, given I've somehow cobbled together a [Discord bot](https://0ccu.lt/dishwasher/) for use.

Well, slow and steady progress for everything. Time on the Earth is limited, but not short.

I hope.
