Why do I have my own personal site? I want to. This is my own little corner of the Innernet and Outernet, and if anything, I'm glad you just stopped to say hi.

If you're wondering why my website is structured like this, I like it. I took a few pages from NETeSCAPE, they're nice folk.

If you wish to follow my efforts, please take a look at [where](/where) I am.
